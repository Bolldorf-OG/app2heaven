Sometimes we can just afterwards discover his traces in our lives - like Moses, who could not see God directly, but rather its \"back\" (cf. Ex 33.18 to 33.). This can be: how a word of God showed you the right way and transformed anything in your life. A turn of events in which I see a fruit of prayer or the surprising act of a providence from God. Giving testimony means: Speaking about how to expirience God's work. Nothing encourages us so much in faith as the testimony of others. This tells us that faith is not a dubious theory but that God lives and acts into our life. Therefore you can write in this section how you have experienced Gods works. These testimonies you can then share with others and thus bear witness to your faith. And of course, read the testimonies of others and let you strengthen by them in faith.",

  "prayer_info_paragraph": "Prayer is more than addressing words to God. It is friendship with God. Prayer is: faith that He is there for you and loves you. Tell him what you have on your mind. Hear what he has to tell you. Or just relax in his presence. You'll learn: Prayer provides you light and strength for your way. When you pray, you will discover who you are and what you want to live.",
  "prayer_info_paragraph2": "Can you imagine a friendship, in which one person not always talks to the other? Lack of communication takes us apart. So we are moving away from God if we don't spend time with him. The relationship with him is the most important one, because it shows us the meaning and the right paths for our lives. That's why prayer is so important for our spiritual life as breathing for the body. The difference is: Breathe goes automatically but pray quickly goes by the board, if you don't decide to it. But this app is here. With it you can organize your life, so that you can schedule time again to consciously spend it in communion with God. This will help you, living your whole life more and more in the presence of God. With that your life in heaven already has begun.",
  "prayer_info_paragraph3": "Scripture tells us that we should “always pray” (Luke 18: 1). This means that we can always live in friendship with God, even in the midst of our everyday activities. But in order to stay with God inwardly, there are times in the day when we specifically turn to God. In addition to the Sunday service (or once a week), we suggest the following:\n\n• A short prayer in the morning, e.g. a sign of the cross, a song of praise, a psalm or a personal prayer. Look ahead to the day and ask God for his blessing!\n\n• A personal prayer time anytime of the day. It's best not to overdo it so that you can keep the time. But it should be long enough to really listen to God and be able to bring all important things to him. It is important to set a fixed time and be faithful to it so that prayer is not left to chance or mood. It is helpful to plan the prayer times in advance and enter them in the calendar.\n\n• A short prayer before going to bed with a look back at the day. Bring everything that was before God so that you can go to bed with gratitude and peace in your heart!",
  "prayer_info_paragraph4": "Jesus has withdrawn to loneliness for prayer. Find yourself a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. It is best to switch the cell phone to \"do not disturb\". In the app under “Prayer time” click on “Start prayer time”, open your prayer with a cross sign and make yourself aware that God is there. When you pray at home, a sign can help, e.g. a candle, a cross or an icon. Prayer is about being completely with God. Try to be quiet in his presence. Many thoughts may come up in you - all of this is part of your life. Make them a prayer, a thank you, or a request. So you bring everything before God. The most important thing is that He is there now. Don't let it bother you if you keep thinking of unimportant things - just let them go by and keep looking for the presence of God.\n\nThere is no particular \"method\" to follow as you continue to pray. After all, prayer is friendship with God, and in friendship friends make their relationship the way it suits them. But there are different forms of prayer. Pick the one that suits you right now and help pray!\n\n• The contemplation: take a text from the Holy Scriptures, e.g. one section at a time from a gospel. Or the daily gospel. Or just open the Bible somewhere - in book form or with the corresponding App2Heaven function. Or read the words you wrote down in the \"Word of God\" section of the app. Read the text slowly and carefully. Does God have something to say to you for your life through this text? How are you going to answer God's word? Does God let you know something to do? But not only the Scriptures, but also a spiritual book, creation and above all your life can be considered. God can speak to us in everything. You can also read an impulse or a certificate from this app. Try to talk to God based on these thoughts. Where do you hear a call from God? A well-tried method of viewing is also the rosary - you can find instructions at www.rosenkranz-beten.de.\n\n• Inner Prayer: You can just speak to God knowing that He is there and loves you. In any friendship, it is important not only to speak or to ask, but also to perceive the person of the other. And just like in a human friendship, you can be with God without words. In inner prayer, you can simply spend a long time remaining silent in God's presence and lingering in His light and love. Such a prayer can do more than a prayer with many words.\n\n• Eucharistic adoration: When the Emmaus disciples asked Jesus \"stay with us!\", Jesus went with them and broke the bread with them. In the celebration of the Eucharist, Jesus stays with us in a special way. Sometimes the consecrated host is shown for prayer, this is called “Eucharistic adoration”. We see the bread that has been transformed and know in faith: this is Jesus. He is there with all his love that he showed us on the cross. He is there as the Risen One who speaks to us today and gives us his Holy Spirit. In Eucharistic adoration you can pray in all the forms explained above, but the special thing is to look at Him - and let Him look at you.\n\nAt the end of the prayer time, look back and think about what you want to take with you from this prayer time. You can write down thoughts that came to you about your life or your beliefs. The writing down helps to record findings and to get them clearer again. It can also be nice to share such spiritual thoughts with people we trust.\n\nPerhaps in prayer you have recognized something that God wants from you and now it is up to you to decide to live life more according to God's will and following Jesus. Then you can write it down in the \"Decisions\" section.\n\nAt the end thank God and deliberately close with a sign of the cross or the Lord's Prayer - and click on \"End prayer time\", then the time is automatically saved. This way you can see how your prayer times are developing.",

Evangelizing means sharing the good news of God's love with other people - in word and deed. So that this doesn't just remain a nice thought, you can write down here who you want to do something for: help, a small service, a visit, a conversation, an invitation to an event. Or maybe you have ideas for initiatives to build the Kingdom of God. If we listen in prayer and if we look at the people around us, God will let us know what to do so that He can come to people and people to Him. It is clear that we cannot “make” a person turn to God - that is the work of the Holy Spirit. But it is also clear: God wants us as his co-workers in order to enable people to experience his love.",

It can be done in prayer or reading the Word of God - or when we really get on our noses. Then we usually take each other A good resolution, but how long good resolutions last is known ... That's why Saint Ignatius of Loyola came up with a useful tool: he suggests thinking about the decision we made in the morning and moving towards the end of the day check how it has been implemented, the advantage of this is that even if you can’t always achieve success, it’s not going to go wrong, you’ll always come across it, so with God’s help you can too Take a close look at stuck habits and slowly but surely practice new, better behaviors. It is true: without Jesus we cannot do anything. He gives us his light to recognize where we turn and the power to implement what is recognized. But it also applies: it can't work without us. We have to walk the path ourselves - and also use the appropriate aids. This function is such a tool to implement what you have known from God with his help in your life. ",
  "words_info_paragraph": "In the words of Scripture, God speaks to us. He shows us what he is like and lets us see important things about our life. We often feel when we read the Bible or hear the services: This word is for me! It makes me understand something important. It shows me something to do. Then it is important that I also record this word. \"Don't just listen to the word, but act accordingly; otherwise you will cheat yourself,\" says the letter to James (1:22). The danger is that we will quickly forget what we have heard and nothing will change in our life. But if we hear the word and act on it, our life becomes and God leads us on his way. This function helps you to listen better to God's word. Write down the words that have spoken to you. Take them back for prayer, look at them again in between or let yourself through the memories remember them in everyday life. Then the words will seep into your heart, they will stay in you and bear fruit. You can decide which current words you want to see immediately, add new words or hide other words. Under \"all words\" you can also see those that have been hidden for some time. Sometimes it is interesting to read these words in context again and discover a “common thread” and see how God leads you through his word.\nYou can decide which current words you want to see immediately, add new words or hide other words.

Here are a few tips on how you can use the individual functions step by step.\n\nSelect the \"Prayer Time\" function and read the information text. Think about how much time you want to take each day for prayer. Personal prayer is the basis for spiritual life. That's why it's important to stay on top of it - even if it didn't work out on a particularly chaotic day. It is best to start with a shorter time that is realistic, e.g. 5 or 10 minutes. In the info text you will find different forms of prayer. Pray as it suits you and does you good. Let yourself be led by the Holy Spirit, who is our teacher in prayer.\n\nIf something clear in prayer that you don't want to forget, you can take notes after the prayer time. If it is a thought that is also uplifting for others, you can also share it with friends who also use the App2Heaven. So you stay in spiritual community.\n\nThe \"Prayer Requests\" menu is also intended for the prayer community. Here you can write down for yourself what you want to pray for, but you can also share these concerns with others so that you can pray for them together.\n\nWe cannot always experience God's work noticeably. It is all the more encouraging to hear testimonies of how God works today. You will find examples of this in the \"Faith Experiences\" function - and you can also write down and share them yourself if they are given to you as gifts.\n\nIf individual words of God particularly appeal to you, e.g. after a service or reading the Bible, you can write it down using the \"Word of God\" function, take it back with your personal prayer or be reminded of it to take it with you in everyday life.\n\nSometimes in prayer we come up with ideas and ideas about what we could do for God and people - you can write this down in the \"Actions\" function and plan when you want to implement it.\n\nThe two functions \"Preview\" and \"Day review\" help you to start and end the day with God.\n\nWe don't always succeed in life the way we want it to. When we experience painfully that we are lagging behind the love that we actually want to give each other and God, God offers us his mercy. In the “Confession” section you will find out what this sacrament is all about, how to prepare for it.\n\nAll these different functions of the app are offers. You do not have to use all of them at the same time, but you can individually select what is currently helping you personally to stay in contact with God. There is also a separate, more detailed info text for each function. The app wants to inspire you and give you suggestions - but the most important thing is that you go your own personal way with God!",

  "confession_info_paragraph": "“If you forgive sins, they are forgiven,” Jesus says to his apostles. Confession gives the wonderful experience that the forgiveness of your sins is audibly promised in the name of Jesus. In this way you can experience God's merciful love first hand and personally. To be sure, going to confession always takes effort and is not easy for anyone. But if you dare not only to show your beautiful facade, but to be completely honest, you can have the delightful experience that God accepts and loves you as you are and opens up a new future for you through His forgiveness. Those who make use of this sacrament learn that confession always gives new joy in life and new impetus to do the good. That is why it is advisable to go to confession regularly (e.g. monthly, but at least before big celebrations such as Christmas and Easter).",
  "confession_info_paragraph2": "1.Take time to prepare for the confession (e.g. with the suggestions for thinking in this app). If you think of things that belong in a confession, you can write them down here so that they are not forgotten. To ensure discretion (your sins concern only you and God!), You can password-protect this area. To make sure that no strangers are snooping around in your sins, you should rather write down keywords or the topics at stake so you know what it is about, but nobody else.\n\n2. Tell God you're sorry and ask for His help to improve you. You can also enter a decision for the future right away.\n\n3. Go to a priest and confess your sins. Do not worry, the priest is not there to judge you, but to bring you God's mercy. If you are having trouble because you haven't been confessing for a long time or don't see some things clearly, just say it. The priest will help you. After the confession, he will give you some pointers, an encouraging encouragement and a penance, i.e. he tells you a prayer or an act. Repentance is to take a step in the right direction and heal something that has been hurt by sin. And above all, the priest gives you the release, the forgiveness of all sins in the name of God. If you enter the confession, all topics for the confession will be deleted - because even God will not remember them!\n\n4. You have become new! Say thank you to God - and start again with him in everyday life.",
